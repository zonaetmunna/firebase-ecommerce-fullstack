### 3. 🔥 Fixed Firebase Seed.ts Script

**Problem**: The seed.ts script was not working properly with Firebase Firestore.

**Solution**:

- ✅ **Improved error handling** with try-catch blocks
- ✅ **Enhanced environment validation** for Firebase configuration
- ✅ **Better logging** with progress indicators and status messages
- ✅ **Proper script execution** with tsx support
- ✅ **Robust data seeding** with duplicate handling

**Enhancements Made**:

```typescript
// Better error handling
try {
  await addDoc(collection(db, "categories"), {
    ...category,
    createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
    updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
  });
  console.log(`   ✅ Added category: ${category.name}`);
} catch (error: any) {
  console.error(`   ❌ Error adding category ${category.name}:`, error.message);
}
```

**Sample Data Included**:

- **Categories**: Electronics, Clothing, Books, Home & Garden, Sports
- **Products**: iPhone 15 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S24, T-shirts, Books, Headphones
- **Orders**: Sample order data with proper structure
- **Notifications**: Welcome messages and system notifications
- **Settings**: Store configuration and system settings

**How to Run**:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 4. 📝 Type Safety Improvements

**Problem**: TypeScript errors due to interface mismatches between global types and component props.

**Solution**:

- ✅ **Fixed interface compatibility** between Redux state and components
- ✅ **Updated optional properties** in component interfaces
- ✅ **Enhanced type safety** throughout the application
- ✅ **Resolved all linter errors** (confirmed with `npm run lint`)

**Key Changes**:

```typescript
// Before (causing errors)
interface Category {
  productCount: number; // Required
  featured: boolean; // Required
}

// After (fixed)
interface Category {
  productCount?: number; // Optional to match ICategory
  featured?: boolean; // Optional to match IProduct
}
```

## 🚀 How to Test the Improvements

### 1. Authentication Testing

1. Go to `/login` page
2. Try login with email/password - observe loading spinner
3. Try Google/Facebook login - observe individual loading states
4. Try password reset - observe proper loading feedback
5. Go to `/signup` page and test all registration flows

### 2. Home Page Testing

1. Visit the home page (`/`)
2. Observe the new modern hero section with animations
3. Check the features section with hover effects
4. Browse categories with interactive cards
5. View featured and trending products
6. Test responsiveness on different screen sizes

### 3. Firebase Seeding

1. Ensure your `.env.local` file has Firebase configuration
2. Run `npm run seed` to populate initial data
3. Check Firebase console to verify data was created
4. Log in with admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@firebasecommerce.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

## 📊 Performance Improvements

### Before

- Large monolithic home page component
- Redux loading state conflicts
- Basic design with minimal user feedback
- Non-functional seed script

### After

- ✅ **Modular component architecture** (4 separate components)
- ✅ **Proper state management** with local loading states
- ✅ **Modern, responsive design** with animations
- ✅ **Functional seeding system** with error handling
- ✅ **Enhanced user experience** with better feedback
- ✅ **Type-safe codebase** with zero linter errors

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Component Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── home/
│       ├── HeroSection.tsx       # Modern hero with stats
│       ├── FeaturesSection.tsx   # Feature cards grid
│       ├── CategoriesSection.tsx # Category cards
